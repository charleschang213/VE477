\begin{problem}{\pbname}
	Finding the inverse of a matrix
\end{problem}

\subsection*{Description}
Two matrices are named inverse to each other if their product is the identity matrix of their size. That is to say $$AA^{-1}=I_n$$

Finding the inverse of a matrix is very important in linear algebra and real life practices, so a good inversion method is necessary. The most intuitive method must be euqation solving, which means building a linear system with regard to vectors and solve it using elimination and substitution. But this can be time-consuming.

However, based on some special features of matrix, the time of calculating the inverse could be reduced. 

Cholesky algorithm is a inverse finding algorithm for Hermittian matrices. A $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is said to be Hermittian if it is conjugate symmetric. In another word $$a_{ij} = \bar{a_{ji}} \text{ for } 1\leq i,j \leq n$$

And if the matrix is a real matrix, being Hermittian is equivalent to being symmetric. 

Cholesky algorithm is based on the Cholesky decomposition of a Hermittian. Cholesky decomposition is decomposing a matrix into the product of an upper triangular matrix with its conjugate transpose. In a word, it is like $$A = R^*R$$ where $R$ is upper triangular.

After decomposing, the original equation can be divided into two equation systems . $$R^*RA^{-1}=I_n \Rightarrow \begin{cases}R^*y &= I_n\\RA^{-1}&=y\end{cases}$$

Solving this equation system is simpler since the coefficient matrices are now tiangular matrices and consequently methods like forward/backward substitution can be directly applied. What's more, based on the Hermittian property the amount of operations can be reduced by nearly half. The decomposition part requires $\frac{n^3}{6}$ operations and the back substitution is a $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ process, so the complexity for Cholesky algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$

Another algorithm is Levinson-Durbin algorithm. This algorithm is designed for a special type of matrices called symmetric Toeplitz matrices. Toeplitz matrices are suqare matrices who have same entries on every diagonals(not only main diagonal), which is to say $$A_{i,j}=a_{i-j} \text{ for } 1\leq i,j \leq n$$ where $\{a_k\}$ is a constant sequence whose index ranges from $-(n-1)$ to $(n-1)$

Levinson-Durbin algorithm uses the idea of recursion. Using recursive call, it first finds the inverse of the $(n-1)\times (n-1)$ matrix on the left-top of $A$(denoted as $A_{n-1}$), denoted as $A_{n-1}^{-1}$. Then it adds a row of $0$ at the the bottom of $A_{n-1}^{-1}$. 

It is clear that if you multiply the result of such operation with $A$, the result will only have differences with the first $(n-1)$ columns in $I_n$ on the last row.

The next step is to find the backward vector of $A$, which is a vector $b_n$ such that (here $e_n$ stands for the $n_{th}$ column in the identity matrix $I_n$) $$Ab_n = e_n$$

After finding this backward vector, weight it and add it to columns in $A_{n-1}^{-1}$ to eliminate the errors in the last row and the append it to the right of $A_{n-1}^{-1}$, you will get $A^{-1}$.

The process of finding $b_n$ is also recursive. And here another term called forward vector needs to be introduced, which is a vector $f_n$ which satisfies $$Af_n=e_1$$

Because the matrices studied are symmetric Toeplitz matrices, $f_n$ is just the reverse of $b_n$, which means $$f_n[i]=b_n[n-i+1] \text{ for } 1\leq i \leq n$$

Here is the process of finding $b_n$. First use recursive call to find $b_{n-1}$, and generate $f_{n-1}$ by reversing $b_{n-1}$. Append a 0 at the end of $f_{n-1}$ and the beginning of $b_{n-1}$, then the product of $A$ and the new two vectors(denoted as $f_{n}^{'},b_{n}^{'}$) will only have difference with $e_1$ and $e_n$ on the last/first row respectively. 

Denote the deviations as $\delta_n,\delta_1$, it can be seen that using linear combinations of these two vectors can eliminate the deviations and generate $b_n$ $$b_n = \frac{1}{1-\delta_1\delta_n}b_{n}^{'}-\frac{\delta_1}{1-\delta_1\delta_n}f_{n}^{'}$$

Levinson recursion originally serves to solve linear systems, and in that case it is of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ complexity. Because here the constant terms are vectors, the complexity will be $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$
